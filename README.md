# DragonBots-Panel
this project was build out of the bootstrap admin panel right avialable here: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/right-responsive-admin-template-WB0BLML90.
the api wich is used is an inpiration of the api from the ts3audiobot included in an self written c# teamspeak 3 music bot.
the backend and all .php files are selfwritten and took about 7days to finish.
the c# ts3musicbot took about 1 week to write because the mainbackend is forked from ts3audiobot.
complete selfwritten parts of this resposity are all .php files.
a livepreview for this website is avialable here: https://dragon-host.ddns.net/bots/login.php.
for testing a login user is: "testing@dragon-host.eu" password: "UFp6HBvtS3YGJBV".
to test that everything works fine you can create an musicbot under the bots page and simply let it connect to 127.0.0.1 or if you have an teamspeak 3 server to your teamspeak server.
